# Python-for-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-Bootcamp

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp! This repository contains the iPython notebooks from the online course that I completed on Udemy, which was taught by Data Scientist Jose Portilla (https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/)

The course covers a wide range of topics related to using Python for Data Science and Machine Learning, including:

- Python Crash Course
- NumPy (Numeric Python)
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Pandas Built-in Data Visualization
- Plotly and Cufflinks
- Geographical Plotting
- Data - Capstone Project
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Trees and Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- K-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis

I created this repository to keep track of my progress through the course and to have a reference for the notebooks while working on related projects. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to me.
